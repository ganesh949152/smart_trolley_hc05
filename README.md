## 🛒 **Smart Shopping Trolley**  

### **📌 Overview**  
The **Smart Shopping Trolley** is an **autonomous shopping assistant** that follows the customer, scans products using **RFID**, and suggests items using AI. It enhances the shopping experience by reducing **checkout time**, **eliminating manual effort**, and **automating product tracking**.  

---

## 🚀 **Features**  
✅ **Autonomous Movement:** The trolley follows the user based on Bluetooth signals.  
✅ **RFID-Based Product Detection:** Automatically scans items added to the cart.  
✅ **AI-Based Product Suggestions:** Provides recommendations based on cart contents.  
✅ **Seamless Checkout:** Eliminates barcode scanning, enabling fast payments.  
✅ **Manual Control Mode:** Users can manually move the trolley using the app.

## ⚙️ **Hardware Components**  
- **Arduino Uno** – Controls the system.  
- **HC-05 Bluetooth Module** – Connects the trolley to the user’s phone.  
- **RC522 RFID Module** – Scans products placed in the cart.  
- **L298N Motor Driver** – Controls the movement of two DC motors.  
- **Two Geared DC Motors** – Moves the trolley autonomously.  
- **12V Battery Pack** – Powers the system.  
- **LM2596 Voltage Regulator** – Converts 12V to required levels.

## 📦 **Installation & Setup**  

### **1️⃣ Install Required Dependencies**  
- Install **Arduino IDE** from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  
- Install the **MFRC522 RFID library** in Arduino IDE (`Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries` > Search `MFRC522`).  

### **2️⃣ Load the Code into Arduino**  
- Connect Arduino to PC via USB.  
- Open **`smart_trolley.ino`** in Arduino IDE.  
- Select **Board: Arduino Uno** and **Port: COMx**.  
- Click **Upload** to flash the code.  

### **3️⃣ Setup Mobile App**  
- Install the **Smart Trolley App** (APK provided).  
- Enable Bluetooth and **pair the trolley** with the phone.  
- Open the app and **connect to HC-05 Bluetooth module**.

## 🛠️ **How It Works**  

### **🔹 Step 1: Power On the System**  
- Switch ON the **battery pack** to power Arduino and motors.  
- HC-05 Bluetooth module becomes **discoverable**.  

### **🔹 Step 2: Connect via Mobile App**  
- Open the **Smart Trolley App** and pair with **HC-05 Bluetooth**.  

### **🔹 Step 3: Autonomous Movement**  
- The trolley **follows the user** based on **RSSI values** of the Bluetooth signal.  
- User can also manually control movement via the app.  

### **🔹 Step 4: Add & Remove Products**  
- Tap **"Add Item"** on the app → Trolley scans **RFID tag** and adds the item to the cart.  
- Tap **"Remove Item"** to rescan and remove the product.  

### **🔹 Step 5: Checkout & Payment**  
- After shopping, click **"Proceed to Payment"**.  
- The app generates the **total bill** and enables **digital payment**.
